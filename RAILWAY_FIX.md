# Railway Deployment Fix - IMPORTANT

## Problem
Railway UI has "Custom Start Command" set to `node server/index.js` which overrides `railway.toml` and causes deployment to fail because:
- Root Directory is set to `server/`
- Custom Start Command tries to run `node server/index.js` 
- This becomes `server/server/index.js` which doesn't exist ❌

## Solution

### Option 1: Via Railway UI (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Settings
2. Find "Custom Start Command" section
3. **DELETE** the value `node server/index.js` (leave it empty)
4. Railway will then use `railway.toml` which has `node index.js` ✅

### Option 2: Railway.toml is already in place
The `server/railway.toml` file contains:
```toml
[start]
command = "node index.js"
```

This should work once Custom Start Command is cleared in UI.

## Pursuing Deployments

After clearing Custom Start Command, deployments should work. The latest code has:
- ✅ `server/railway.toml` with correct start command
- ✅ `/` endpoint for healthcheck
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

## Verify Fix

After next deployment, check logs for:
```
✓ Server successfully started and listening on port 8080
```

If you see this, the deployment is successful!
